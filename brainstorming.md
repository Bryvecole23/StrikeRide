🧠 Milestone 1 – Activity 1: Brainstorming
Team: SmartDroids
Members: Bryce Alexander, Joshlyn Thomas, Naser Halloum, and Keshawn Ross

This document captures our team’s brainstorming, idea evaluation, and final app decision for Milestone 1.

✅ Step 1: Generate New App Ideas

Each team member lists at least 3 new app ideas with brief descriptions.

👤 Member 1 – Bryce Alexander
Idea 1: Strike Ride

A FAMU-exclusive electric scooter rental app that helps students quickly locate, unlock, and ride scooters around campus. Integrates FAMU ID tap-to-pay, shows scooter availability, battery levels, and designated parking/charging zones.

Idea 2: FAMU App Renovation

A modern redesign of the current FAMU mobile app to improve usability, navigation, and student engagement. Features a cleaner UI, faster access to student tools, live Venom bus tracking, campus events feed, push notifications, and improved performance.

Idea 3: VenomSafe

Description: A real-time campus safety app for FAMU that lets students quickly access FAMU PD, share live location with trusted friends, receive safety alerts, and use a “virtual walk-home” feature that tracks them until they reach their destination.

Idea 1: EventFinder

A local events discovery app that shows concerts, festivals, meetups, sports events, and campus activities happening near the user. Uses a free events API and displays event details with images, dates, and ticket links.

Idea 2: DormDash

A dorm-to-dorm delivery system for snacks, small items, or student services (haircuts, tutoring, laundry folding). Students can accept jobs and earn extra money.

Idea 3: TaskTrak

A simple productivity app that helps students track assignments, exams, due dates, and personal tasks. Includes notifications and color-coded priority levels.

👤 Member 4 – Keshawn Ross
Idea 1: Rattler Rooms
An app that shows open study spaces on campus in real time with filters for noise level and crowding.

Idea 2: FAMU CONNECT
Helps students find study partners, group projects members, and organizations based on different interests.

Idea 3: Rattler Eats Displays real time dinning menus, hours, and crowd levels.

As a group, vote and choose the top 3 ideas to evaluate.

🟩 Top 3 Selected Ideas

Strike Ride

FAMU App Renovation

EventFinder

✅ Step 2b: Evaluate Each of the Top 3 Ideas

Evaluate each idea using CodePath’s required criteria:

Mobile

Story

Market

Habit

Scope

📌 Evaluation – Strike Ride

Mobile:
Highly mobile-driven (maps, GPS tracking, unlocking). Great use of features unavailable on desktop.

Story:
Solves a major transportation gap for FAMU students since city scooters are banned on campus.

Market:
Clear audience — FAMU undergrad/grad students, faculty, staff.

Habit:
Used multiple times daily for getting to class/events.

Scope:
MVP is achievable: scooter map, unlock/start ride, end ride, parking zones.

📌 Evaluation – FAMU App Renovation

Mobile:
Strong need for optimization. Students heavily rely on mobile for university tasks.

Story:
Improves an existing tool that students find slow or outdated; boosts engagement.

Market:
Extremely large — entire FAMU student population.

Habit:
Used weekly for bus tracking, courses, financial aid, campus resources.

Scope:
Broader system; MVP redesign is manageable but full overhaul is large.

📌 Evaluation – EventFinder

Mobile:
Perfect for mobile: browse events quickly, view details, location, and tickets.

Story:
Students often miss cool events due to lack of a simple discovery tool. This solves that problem.

Market:
Anyone looking for events — students, Tallahassee locals, visitors.

Habit:
Checked weekly or even daily to see what’s happening around campus or the city.

Scope:
MVP is very achievable:

API call → event list

RecyclerView display

Event details screen

Ticket link
✅ Step 2c: Final App Decision
🏁 Final Chosen App:

Strike Ride
(or update if the group decides otherwise)

Why We Chose This App:

Strong mobile-first experience

Clear value to students

Daily usage potential

Realistic MVP for CodePath timeline

Can scale up with optional features
